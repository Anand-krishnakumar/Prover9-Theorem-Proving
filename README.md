# Prover9-Theorem-Proving

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The objective of this project is to prove if a goal statement follows from a given set of statements.
Given a storyline, the important axioms from that storyline will be derived.
These axioms will then be converted to First order logic form and then to Clause Normal form(CNF).
Using the Clause Normal Form statements we will be able to prove whether a goal statement is provable or not with the help of an automatic theorem prover like Prover9.
Prover9 applies the inference rules and resolution refutation principles to automatically prove theorems.
